# ECG-meet-BLE
A compression algorithm for realtime ECG data transmission over BLE advertisements. Independently developed as a final project for my Wireless Protocols for IoT class, along with a research-style writeup.

Here are some stats I gathered on my own ECG recordings to help me create my algorithm. More information is in the writeup PDF.

Statistics on ECG Data:
    
    Entire dataset:
